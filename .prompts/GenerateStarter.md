# Generate Starter Project: Module 7, Exercise 1

## Step 1: Confirm the Solution
Verify that Mod8/Labfiles/Solution/ has a subfolder for this exercise and it is using .NET 10.

## Step 2: Read Lab Instructions  
Read the LabGuide for this Module and Exercise. List all tasks/code that students ADD during this exercise.

## Step 3: Create Starter
COPY the Solution Exercise folder for this module and exercise to the Starter folder.
Remove any TODO comments associated with the previous exercise.
Remove student-added code for the exercise. 
Insert TODO comments matching task descriptions from the lab instructions.

## Step 4: Check instructions to run app
At the end of each exercise there is usually an instruction to test the web application, but the steps might be outdated, so ensure that the instructions are something like:
    1. [ ] In **Solution Explorer**, on the **Debug** menu, double-click **Start Without Debugging**.
    2. [ ] In Microsoft Edge, navigate to the XXXXX page.
    3. [ ] In Microsoft Edge, if the **Let localhost use your location?** message appears, click **Yes**.
...where XXXXX is the page you are supposed to start with. The rest of the instructions in that step should be okay.

## Report
Summarize: What code/markup was removed? What TODO comments were added?
