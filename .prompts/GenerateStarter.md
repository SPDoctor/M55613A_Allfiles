# Generate Starter Project: Module 8, Exercise 1

## Step 1: Confirm the Solution
Verify that ModX/Labfiles/Solution/ has a subfolder for this exercise and it is using .NET 10 (where ModX is the folder for the module, e.g. for Module 1 this would be Mod01, Module 2 would be Mod02, and so on).

## Step 2: Read Lab Instructions  
Read the LabGuide for this Module and Exercise. List all tasks/code that students ADD during this exercise. The lab guide is in the folder LabGuide, and the file is for LabX, where X is the module number, e.g. for Module 1 this would be Lab1.md, Module 2 would be Lab2.md, and so on)

## Step 3: Create Starter
COPY the Solution Exercise folder for this module and exercise to the Starter folder.
Remove any TODO comments associated with the previous exercise.
Remove student-added code for the exercise. 
Insert TODO comments matching task descriptions from the lab instructions.

## Step 4: Check instructions to run app
At the end of each exercise there is usually an instruction to test the web application, but the steps might be outdated, so ensure that the instructions are something like:
    1. [ ] In **Solution Explorer**, on the **Debug** menu, double-click **Start Without Debugging**.
    2. [ ] In Microsoft Edge, navigate to the XXXXX page.
    3. [ ] In Microsoft Edge, if the **Let localhost use your location?** message appears, click **Yes**.
...where XXXXX is the page you are supposed to start with. The rest of the instructions in that step should be okay.

## Report
Summarize: What code/markup was removed? What TODO comments were added?
